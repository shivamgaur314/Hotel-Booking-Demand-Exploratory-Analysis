# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Exploratory-Analysis

I used the dataset that contains data about hotel bookings
We cleaned and preprocessed the data and then we performed the exploratory data analysis to extract information from the data to answer the following questions.

1.How Many Booking Were Cancelled?

2.What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?

3.What is the percentage of booking for each year?

4.Which is the busiest month for hotels?

5.Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?

We learned that

1.Almost 35% of bookings were canceled.

2.More than 60% of the population booked the City hotel.

3.More than double bookings were made in 2016, compared to the previous year. But the bookings decreased by almost 15% next year.

4.Most bookings were made from July to August. And the least bookings were made at the start and end of the year.

5.Couple (or 2 adults) is the most popular accommodation type. So hotels can make arrangement plans accordingly
